# Heya ðŸ‘‹

I am Harun, currently an IT student. I spend most of my time reading about, exploring, and researching a wide field of interests. Now, I am switching the focus onto producing, especially in the fields of software engineering, and applying my knowledge in a fun, creative, and rhizomatic manner.
